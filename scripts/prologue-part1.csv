santa,shock,|Huh ? I can’t see a thing. The lights are off…|
santa,shock,"|Except… near me, there’s a bit of light, for some reason.|"
santa,wonder,|Let’s see… I’m sitting on some kind of bed. I should probably just…|

santa,uneasy,|I’m stuck ! There’s something sturdy around my neck keeping it against the wall!|
santa,uneasy,Urgh ! What the heck !?
santa,uneasy,"|Instinctively, I start struggling to try getting it off. But I’m quickly interrupted by a voice.|"
tenmyouji,none,"Will you stop doing this, imbecile !?"
santa,uneasy,Huh ? Who said that ?
santa,uneasy,"|I stop struggling, and look around, in the direction this voice was coming from, and finally notice something in the dark. Standing on a table near me was a walkie-talkie. There was a small, flickering red light on it.|"
santa,serious,"You’re talking to me through this walkie-talkie, aren’t you ?"
tenmyouji,walkie,"Indeed, I am."
santa,uneasy,"So, you’re the bastard that kidnapped me and locked me in here ?"
tenmyouji,walkie,"No, I’m not. I was also kidnapped and locked in here, for your information."
santa,surprise,|Huh?|
tenmyouji,walkie,"In fact, I believe we’re in the same situation. Are you sitting on a bed, in some kind of ship cabin, with an iron collar pinning you against the wall ?"
santa,shock,"Uh… yeah, that’s pretty much it."
tenmyouji,walkie,"Well, it’s exactly the same for me. And when you started struggling like an idiot, my collar started shaking and tightening around my neck."
santa,surprise,"Oh… so, are our collars connected somehow ?"
tenmyouji,walkie,It would seem like it…
santa,wonder,In that case... we should be careful not to fiddle too much with our collars.
tenmyouji,walkie,"Indeed... and there's something else, too."
santa,surprise,What ?
tenmyouji,walkie,There's a writing on the wall here : it says the collar will progressively tighten up.
santa,shock,Seriously !? Then that means... we must leave this place quickly !
