santa,surprise,,Huh ? Where the hell are we ?
june,uneasy,,No idea… I don’t even remember how we got here.
june,wonder,,There's not even a door. How are we gonna get out of here ?
santa,,,"Well, there’s no use standing around. We should seek a way out."
june,,,"Yeah, you’re right."

june,wonder,,"The sign on the wall reads… ""Seek a way out"""
santa,serious,,"Yes, that’s already what we’re trying to do. Thanks for your contribution, sign."

cmd,beginDialogue,tableInspect,
santa,,,Seems like a regular table to me.
june,,,Do you think it might hold some kind of secret ?
santa,surprise,,"I mean… it’s just a table, June."
june,happy,,"Well, you never know."
santa,,,There’s nothing on it. What kind of secret could there be ?
june,uneasy,,"I don't know… call it a hunch, but I feel like something hidden there."
santa,surprise,,|Yeah… I wouldn't count too much on that.|

cmd,beginDialogue,chairInspect,
june,surprise,,Santa… I think there’s something behind the chair.
santa,none,,"|June walked over to the chair, and pulled it away from the wall. And indeed, there was an object, hidden between the chair and the wall.|"
june,shock,,Is that… an *axe* !?
santa,shock,,Seems like it…
santa,none,,"|I took the axe in my hands. It was pretty heavy. No doubt about it, it’s a real one.|"
none,,,`You obtained the axe.`
santa,smug,,"It's a shame there's no door. We would have been able to break it down, with it."
june,uneasy,,"Anyway, we probably shouldn’t tell Clover we found this."
santa,wonder,,"Yeah, you’re right…"

cmd,beginDialogue,axeOnChair,
santa,angry2,,"Step back, June."
june,surprise,,Uh ? Okay…
santa,none,,"|I raised up my axe, before sending crashing down on the chair, which was instantly broken down.|"
june,worry,,… Why did you do that ?
santa,surprise,,I thought it might reveal some clue.
june,wonder,,Well… let’s just hope we don’t want to sit down later.
santa,smug,,"Honestly, if it broke so easily to a single strike, it was probably very fragile. I wouldn’t really be confident sitting on it."
june,wonder,,… Guess you’re right.

cmd,beginDialogue,axeOnTable,
santa,angry2,,"Okay, I’m gonna break this table down !"
june,worry,,Are you sure about it ?
santa,angry2,,"Don’t worry, it will be fine. It’s not like we need it."
santa,none,,"|With a single axe strike, the table was broken in two.|"
june,shock,,"Oh, look ! There’s something underneath."
santa,surprise,,"Yeah, you’re right. It is… a trapdoor ? How did we not notice it ?"
june,happy,,Ha ! I knew this table was hiding something.
cmd,endDialogue,,

cmd,beginDialogue,trapInspect,
june,wonder,,Do you think it’s the exit ?
santa,,,There’s only one way to know.
santa,none,,"|I grabbed the handle of the trapdoor, and opened it. Under it was a crawlspace.|"
june,happy,,"Well, looks like we’ve found it."
santa,,,That’s right. Let’s go.
cmd,endDialogue,,

cmd,beginDialogue,axeOnTrapdoor,
santa,angry2,,Yaaaaaah !
santa,none,,"|Using the axe again, I broke down the trapdoor.|"
santa,reveal,,Look ! There’s a crawlspace under the trapdoor. That’s gotta be the exit.
june,wonder,,"Yeah, but… couldn’t you just have opened it ?"
santa,surprise,,"Uh… yeah, I guess."
june,happy,,"Well, guess that doesn’t matter. We fount the exit !"
santa,,,"That’s right. Okay, let’s go !"
